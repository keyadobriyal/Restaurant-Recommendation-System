A Restaurant Recommendation System is proposed to address the challenge users face in choosing from the vast and growing number of restaurant options. Leveraging content-based filtering techniques, the system analyzes user preferences, locality, ratings, cuisine, and past experiences to provide personalized suggestions. The primary goal is to save user time and simplify the decision-making process by filtering a large dataset and providing the most relevant restaurant recommendations. Developed using Python libraries and machine learning (including data preprocessing, vectorization, and cosine similarity), the system increases user convenience and business retention rates. Future enhancements include incorporating collaborative filtering and real-time feedback to evolve into a more accurate hybrid recommendation system. This tool offers an efficient solution to the contemporary need for quick and easy decision support in the food industry.
